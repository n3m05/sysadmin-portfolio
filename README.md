# Sysadmin Portfolio Toolkit

A collection of practical system administration tools focused on monitoring, automation, backup reliability, and network diagnostics. This repository demonstrates real-world operational skills used to maintain, secure, and troubleshoot Linux and Windows systems in small to mid-sized infrastructure environments.

## Overview
This toolkit was designed to support common systems administration tasks such as system health monitoring, proactive alerting, automated backups with retention policies, and network diagnostics. The projects emphasize reliability, logging, and automation — core responsibilities of a systems administrator.

## Features
- System health checks with logging and email alerting
- Automated backup scripts with configurable retention policies and restore validation
- Network diagnostic tools for host reachability and port availability
- Scripts written with operational use in mind, not one-off execution

## Use Cases
- Detect disk, memory, or service issues before they cause outages
- Verify backup success and enforce retention policies
- Quickly diagnose network connectivity and service availability issues
- Automate routine administrative tasks to reduce manual effort

## Design Principles
- Automation over manual intervention
- Logging and observability for troubleshooting
- Safe defaults and predictable behavior
- Designed to be extendable for additional infrastructure needs

## Technologies Used
- Bash / PowerShell
- Linux and Windows environments
- SMTP/email alerting
- Standard networking utilities

## Purpose
This repository exists to demonstrate hands-on systems administration skills, operational thinking, and infrastructure automation. It reflects the type of tooling commonly built and maintained by junior to mid-level systems administrators in production environments.
